2 Prototypes for Alternative Password Systems

AssociativeAuth uses word association. Create a new user and complete a word association game, then recall those associations to log in.

ChessAuth uses a sequence of moves in chess. Creating new users is not supported, but play the white side of a user's assigned PGN file to authenticate.
(Note, since the chess program uses the python-chess library, a venv or install of the module is required. a requirements.txt is included).
